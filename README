time you choose on your blog (or to any email address).

STATE OF THIS CODE:
-------------------

* Note that 'master' has never been fully pushed to prod, it has more features than
  the current production code. (dynamic titles, twitter name change resilience...)

* Scheduling and Delivery relies on Gearman where it should rather rely
  on TheSchwartz (with builtin retries) - and could use a mechanism scheme in general.

* The project started as a hack in 2007 and grew wildely when time permitted
  (there was no company to support it or anything)

* At the present time this code is largely unmaintained

WARRANTY:
---------

This code doesn't come with any warranty of any kind.
